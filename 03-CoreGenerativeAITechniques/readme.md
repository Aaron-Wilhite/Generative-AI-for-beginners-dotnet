#### What you'll learn in this lesson:

- ðŸŒŸ LLM completions/chat flows
- ðŸ”— Functions & Plugins with LLMs  
- ðŸ”Ž Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- ðŸ‘€ Vision-based AI approaches  
- ðŸ”Š Audio creation and transcription  
- ðŸ§© Agents & assistants

For this lesson, we will subdivide the content into the following sections:

- [Chat, LLM completions, and function calling](01-lm-completions-functions.md)
- [Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), vision applications and audio](02-rag-vision-audio.md)
- [Agents](03-agents.md)

Starting with Langauge Model completions and Chat applications and function implementations with language models in .NET.
