## Introduction to Generative AI Concepts

### Understanding the Transformer Framework

Before everything, we need to cover some of the basic points for the Framework empowering all of this. The Transformer architecture, introduced in 2017, has transformed the field of natural language processing. Utilizing self-attention mechanisms, Transformers can process data using attention, allowing models to understand context more effectively.

![*Figure: Simplified illustration of the Transformer model.*](./images/transformer-archtecture.png)

This approach has paved the way for advanced language models like GPT, enhancing tasks such as translation, summarization, and text generation.

### A quick refresh on Generative AI

Generative AI focuses on creating models that can produce content, understand context in text better than previous techniques, and generate human-like responses. Some of the applications of generative AI include:

- **Text Generation**: Crafting human-like text for chatbots, content, and text completion.
- **Image Generation and Analysis**: Producing realistic images, enhancing photos, and detecting objects.
- **Code Generation**: Writing code snippets or scripts.

Generative AI models are trained on vast datasets, learning patterns and relationships to generate outputs. They can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, making them versatile and adaptable to various applications. Those models have multiple variations, input to text, to embeddings (embeddings are a way to represent text in a numerical format), to images and, even, to video.

However, as a developer, you need to understand that this is not magic, and it is important to understand the limitations and constraints of these models, in the end, these mathematical models are just that, mathematical models. As such, we need to understand how to use them effectively, and that is where prompt engineering comes in.

### Reviewing Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing effective inputs to guide AI models toward desired outputs. It involves:

- **Clarity**: Making instructions clear and unambiguous.
- **Context**: Providing necessary background information.
- **Constraints**: Specifying any limitations or formats.

Some best practices for prompt engineering include, prompt design, clear instructions, task breakdown, one shot and few shot learning, and prompt tuning. Plus, trying and testing different prompts to see what works best for your specific use case.

## AI Development Tools and Libraries for .NET

Generative AI development needs a set of tools and libraries to auxiliate the prototype and development of applications, and the .NET ecosystem offers a range of options for AI development.
Our development journey in .NET starts with understanding the tools and libraries available to us, AI Tooling is a key part of the AI development process, and it is important to understand the tools available to you to decrease the time to market of your AI applications.

### Microsoft.Extensions.AI (MEAI)

As AI development becomes more prevalent, Microsoft has introduced the Microsoft.Extensions.AI (MEAI) library to simplify the integration of AI models into .NET applications. MEAI provides a unified set of libraries for working with various AI services, enabling developers to leverage AI capabilities seamlessly.

These libraries helps interacting with AI services, such as small and large language models (SLMs and LLMs), embeddings, and middleware that can be used to orchestrate AI workflows. MEAI also provides tools for context management, and error handling, streamlining the AI development process.

![*Figure: Microsoft.Extensions.AI (MEAI) library.*](./images/meai-architecture-diagram.png)

Using an unified API, MEAI allows developers to work with different AI services, such as Azure AI Inference, Ollama, and OpenAI, in a consistent manner. This simplifies the integration of AI models into .NET applications, adding flexibility for developers to choose the best AI services for their projects and specific requirements.

Making common abstractions for AI services, MEAI provides a consistent way to interact with AI models, reducing the complexity of integrating AI capabilities into .NET applications. For example:

```csharp
public interface IChatClient : IDisposable 
{ 
‚ÄØ ‚ÄØ Task<ChatCompletion> CompleteAsync(...); 
‚ÄØ ‚ÄØ IAsyncEnumerable<StreamingChatCompletionUpdate> CompleteStreamingAsync(...); 
‚ÄØ ‚ÄØ ChatClientMetadata Metadata { get; } 
‚ÄØ ‚ÄØ TService? GetService<TService>(object? key = null) where TService : class; 
} 
```

This interface defines a chat client that can complete chat prompts asynchronously, stream updates, and provide metadata. It also allows accessing services using a generic method, enabling developers to interact with AI models in a flexible and efficient way.  Plus, you can quickly integrate middleware, test and debug models, prompts, and more.

### Semantic Kernel (SK)

Semantic Kernel is a lightweight SDK that enables developers to have a quick AI middleware into their .NET applications. It can connect to various AI services, APIs, to perform actions, connecting code with out-of-the-box connectors and services, using the OpenAPI standard, connecting to any application needing Generative services and creating agents.

![*Figure: Semantic Kernel (SK) SDK.*](./images/semantic-kernel.png)

Semantic Kernel supports Java, Python, and .NET, offering a plethora of connectors, functions and plugins for integration. Some of the key features of Semantic Kernel include:

- **Kernel Core**: Provides the core functionality for the Semantic Kernel, including connectors, functions, and plugins, to interact with AI services and models. The kernel is the heart of the Semantic Kernel, being available to services and plugins, retrieving them when needed, monitoring Agents, and being an active middleware for your application. 


    For example, it can pick the best AI service for a specific task, build plus send the prompt to the service, and return the response to the application. Below, a diagram of the Kernel Core in action:

    ![*Figure: Semantic Kernel (SK) Kernel Core.*](./images/semantic-kernel-core.png)

- **AI Service Connectors**: Provides an abstraction layer to expose AI services to multiple providers, with a common and consistent interface, some examples like Chat Completion, Text to Image, Text to Speech, and Audio to Text.

- **Vector Store Connectors**: Exposes vector stores to multiple providers, via a common and consistent interface, allowing developers to work with embeddings, vectors, and other data representations.

- **Functions and Plugins**: Offers a range of functions and plugins for common AI tasks, such as function processing, Prompt Templating, Text Search, and more. Connecting this to the AI Service/Model, creating implementations for RAG, and agents, for example.

- **Prompt Templating**: Provides tools for prompt engineering, including prompt design, testing, and optimization, to enhance AI model performance and accuracy. Allowing developers to create and test prompts, and optimize them for specific tasks.

- **Filters**: Auxiliates to take custom actions on the data, during the chat completion, for example, filtering out unwanted data, or adding custom data to the response.

In Semantic Kernel, a full loop would look like the diagram below:
